# Book Recomendation System  Using Collaborative Filtering 

## Point to be on note:
### I've used python version 3.9 so,create a venv of python 3.9

### DATASET: INSIDE data.rar file
### just unzip it
### second thing is that first run Book recomender.ipynb file to make sure there must not be  any error exists.
### then all 3 pickle file is generated , so for checking that every thing is working fine, run one.ipynb.



## and all set 
## run app.py and enjoy !!
